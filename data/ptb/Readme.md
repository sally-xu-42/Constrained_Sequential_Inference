# Penn Treebank
To setup the parsing experiments, first setup the Penn Treebank so that it is accessible by NLTK by placing the `BROWN` and `WSJ` directories under `nltk_data/corpora/ptb` (see [here](http://www.nltk.org/howto/corpus.html) for more information).
Then, run the `setup.sh` script from the root of the repository.
It will output the training, validation, and testing splits into this directory.
